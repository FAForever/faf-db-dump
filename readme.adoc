# FAForever database dump

In this repository you find an anonymized excerpt of the FAF production database (dump.sql) and scripts to generate
it from a copy (!) of the production database (sanitize.sql).

It's main use is to verify database migrations against at least partially real world data.

## Sanitize

If you run a sanitize query, please note the loop inside the SQL! Manual work is required!
