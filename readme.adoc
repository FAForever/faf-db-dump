# FAForever database dump

In this repository you find an anonymized excerpt of the FAF production database (dump.sql) and scripts to generate
it from a copy (!) of the production database (sanitize.sql).

It's main use is to verify database migrations against at least partially real world data.

## Sanitize

If you run a sanitize query, please note the loop inside the SQL! Manual work is required!

## Dump

If you imported the production database using a faf-db from faf-stack you may run

`docker exec -i -u root faf-db mysqldump -u root -p --single-transaction faf_lobby > dump.sql`

Afterwards you need to edit the dump.sql:

* replace faf_lobby with faf
* replace all `SQL SECURITY DEFINER` to +DEFINER=`root`@`%`+ (otherwise Schemaspy will break)
